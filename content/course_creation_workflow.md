# Typical Course Creation Workflow

Here are the typical set of tools and resources that are used to create a course that uses Jupyterhub.

1. Create a private Github repository for instructor materials and solutions to notebooks
2. Create a public Github repository for student notebooks
3. Generate your notebooks, there are few different resources here, using the private repository
4. Copy the student version of the notebooks to the public repository
5. Determine how you want to distribute notebooks to students:
    - Use nbgitpuller links for students to load each notebook
    - Student Download the notebooks from Github and upload to the hub
6. Determine how students will turn in notebooks
