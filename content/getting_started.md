# Getting Started

### Get a Hub
If you need a hub configured for your institution or would like to set up a meeting, please email: sean.smorris@berkeley.edu

### JupyterHub
Your institution's hub address will look like this: **\<institution\>.jupyter.cal-icor.org**

### Authentication and User Management
The hub does not require any user management. Anyone from your institution can authenticate using the authentication method that best suits your needs, including using your institution's email address as an account.

### File Storage
Each user has 10 GB of file storage. Files and accounts will be removed from the service after three years of inactivity. If you require more than 10 GB of file storage per user or need longer archival periods, we can work on a special arrangement.

### Costs
This is a free service intended for California Educational Institutions.
